  Generic Connection Brokering (GCB) is a firewall/NAT traversal
  solution that enables communications over firewall/NAT. It consists
  of daemon processes and a communication library that is supposed to
  be linked with applications. GCB enables connections into networks
  behind firewall/NAT by reversing the direction of the connections.
