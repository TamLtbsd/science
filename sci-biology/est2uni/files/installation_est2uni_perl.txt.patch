 Although the clustering software could consider that two unigenes are not similar
 enough to be merged, it is useful to know which are these similar clusters of unigenes.
 Accordingly, EST2uni does a clustering of the unigenes, and these clusters are named
-'superunigenes'. This analysis is done thorough a BLAST search, followed by
+'superunigenes'. This analysis is done through a BLAST search, followed by
 parsing the results. Unigenes with a similarity high enough (above user-defined threshold
 parameters) are then clustered in a superunigene.
